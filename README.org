* approach
  The existing nginx_lua documentation is a markdown file that comes
  from a wiki file, converted via an ad-hoc wiki2markdown.pl file.

  The rendering of the markdown in Github renders anchors as <a
  href="foo" class="anchor">. In this case, "foo" cannot contain any
  dot, so the wiki2markdown removes all dots (among other characters)
  in the links, expecting them to match after the github render.

  That leaves us with a markdown that is prepared to be rendered in
  the github approach, because a link to #ngxsay will link to the
  header 'ngx.say' (because it will be trimmed), but it's invalid in
  itself.

  wiki
   - text: == ngx.say ==
   - link: [ngx.say][ngx.say]
   - anchor: == ngx.say ==

  markdown
   - text: == ngx.say ==
   - link: [ngx.say](#ngxsay)
   - anchor: == #ngxsay ==

  I'm trying to fix all that by preserving the dots everywhere and
  using pandoc, which renders anchors like <h1 id="foo">, thus
  allowing dots
